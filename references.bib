@book{Smith2011,
abstract = {"Spectral Audio Signal Processing is the fourth book in the music signal processing series by Julius O. Smith. One can say that human hearing occurs in terms of spectral models. As a result, spectral models are especially useful in audio applications. For example, with the right spectral model, one can discard most of the information contained in a sound waveform without changing how it sounds. This is the basis of modern audio compression techniques."--Publisher's description. Fourier transforms and theorems -- Spectrum analysis windows -- FIR digital filter design -- Spectrum analysis of sinusoids -- Spectrum analysis of noise -- Time-frequency displays -- Overlap-add STFT processing -- Filter-bank view of the STFT -- Applications of the STFT -- Multirate filter banks.},
